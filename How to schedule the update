More R info
Below is a couple of things that should be useful for finding info on packages and auto running scripts. Let me know if you have any questions.

For packages and package documentation

https://cran.r-project.org/. Then Packages on the left, then Table of available packages, sorted by name. 
if you search “cansim” then click it, you will see a link to download the reference manual and a “getting started link” that usually has good examples.

 


Auto running scripts

If you click on add-ins, and then schedule r scripts at the bottom you can schedule when jobs will run. I think you need to keep R open though.
